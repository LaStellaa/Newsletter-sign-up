### What I learned

To build the main component of this project i followed a video from Kevin Powell https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell. It was interesting to see advance CSS in action and i've leaned a lot by coding along! The success design and the JS components were code by me.

### Continued development

I definitely want to keep focusing on CSS and develop more advanced and optimal skills, as well as keep practicing JS fundamentals.
